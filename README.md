## Plugin configuration

1. Input Directory

    Specify the directory in which the log file for processing is expected. The name of the log file must be input.log.

2. Keep original timing

    The processing of the log file can be done according to the original timestamps of the recorded records. The plugin will process the file and wait for the next record according to the delta of the timestamp in the original file.
3. Use original timestamps

    While processing data via the canbus, SignalK creates the timestamps according to the processing time. With this option you can keep the original timestamps recorded in the log file.
